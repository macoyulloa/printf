NAME
	printf - format and print data


SYNOPSIS

	#include "holberton.h"

	_printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...


DESCRIPTION:

	This function write the output under the control of a format string that  specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output. It also return the number of characters printed (not including the '\0' character used to end output to strings).
	 
	The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications. Each conversion specification is introduced by the % character. After the %, the following appear in sequence:

	Print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT:

	FORMATS:

	%c: The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
	%d: The int (or appropriate variant) argument is converted to signed decimal (d and i), and then it is printed.
	%i: The int (or appropriate variant) argument is converted to signed decimal (d and i), and then it is printed
	%x: The argument is converted to an octal value and it is stored in string that is later printed.
	%s: The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating NUL character.


EXAMPLE

#include "holberton.h"

/**
 * main - examples and uses of the _printf()
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */
int main(void)
{
	char i = 'g';
	char j[] = "cadena de caracteres";
	char h = ' ';
	int n = 321, m = 245;

	_printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
	/**print a character, variable char type**/
	_printf("%c\n", i);
	 /**print a string, variable char * type**/
 	_printf("%s\n", j);
	/**more examples of the uses**/
	_printf("hola Male, %c, funcion√≥\n", i);
	_printf("hola mi nombre, %s, gracias\n", j);
	_printf("hola mi nombre, %c, gracias\n", h);
	/**print of number: integers and decimals numbers**/
	_printf("hola mi, %d , gracias\n", n);
	_printf("%d , gracias\n", m);
	_printf("%i\n", n);
	return (0);
}
